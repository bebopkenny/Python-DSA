# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repo is a collection of my notes, code, and personal takes as I work through data structures and algorithms in Python. I’m using two main resources to guide me: the DSA course from Boot.dev and Greg Hogg’s YouTube playlist on DSA theory.

My goal here isn’t to just finish a course or copy over solutions. I’m trying to get to a point where I understand how things work under the hood, and where I can solve real problems without relying on shortcuts.

## Why I’m Doing This

I’m aiming to build a strong foundation in core computer science topics. These are the things that show up in interviews, in systems work, and in moments when libraries or frameworks stop being helpful and you need to think from scratch.

I’ve had trouble with DSA in the past — especially under pressure — so I’m revisiting everything, step by step, and documenting it here. My focus is on writing clean, efficient code and building up the pattern recognition needed to approach harder problems with confidence.

## What This Repo Covers

Every file or folder reflects a topic I’ve worked through or a concept I’ve practiced. Some of this is direct practice from the Boot.dev platform, some of it is from Greg Hogg’s video walkthroughs, and some of it is me trying to re-implement something I messed up on earlier.

### Topics

- Time and space complexity (Big O)
- Sorting algorithms (selection, merge, quick, counting)
- Arrays and strings
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Hash maps and hash sets
- Stacks and queues
- Recursion and call stack tracing
- Binary search
- Trees, binary search trees
- Heaps and priority queues
- Graphs and traversal (BFS, DFS)
- Two pointer and sliding window patterns
- Recursive backtracking
- Dynamic programming (both memoization and tabulation)
- Bit manipulation

This is a work in progress. I’m not rushing through anything. If a concept doesn’t click, I slow down and try a different resource or example until it makes sense.

## How I’m Learning

### 1. Boot.dev (Lane Wagner)

Boot.dev takes a hands-on approach. You build each structure from scratch and are constantly coding. Lane explains things clearly and doesn’t overcomplicate it. The course has helped me understand not just how things work, but why they’re built that way in the first place.

### 2. Greg Hogg (YouTube)

Greg’s DSA videos are straight to the point. He walks through the theory, shows the code, and keeps things grounded. I especially like how he handles the “why” behind things like dynamic arrays and recursion. His playlist covers nearly every major topic that comes up in interviews.

## Final Thoughts

This repo isn’t polished or perfect. It’s meant to be honest. You’ll see working code, broken code, notes to myself, and questions I’m still figuring out. If you're also working through DSA in Python, feel free to poke around — or even better, try rebuilding some of this stuff yourself.

And if you’ve ever felt stuck on these topics, same. But it’s starting to make sense now, and that’s worth pushing through.
