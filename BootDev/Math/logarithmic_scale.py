Logarithmic Scale

In some cases, data can span several orders of magnitude, making it difficult to visualize on a linear scale. A logarithmic scale can help by compressing the data so that it's easier to understand.

For example, at LockedIn we have influencers with follower counts ranging from 1 to 1,000,000,000. If we want to plot the follower count of each influencer on a graph, it would be difficult to see the differences between the smaller follower counts. We can use a logarithmic scale to compress the data so that it's easier to visualize.
Assignment

Write a function log_scale(data, base) that takes a list of positive numbers data, and a logarithmic base, and returns a new list with the logarithm of each number in the original list, using the given base.

You may want to use the math.log() function.

Example:
log_scale([1, 10, 100, 1000], 10)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

log_scale([1, 2, 4, 8], 2)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
'''

def log_scale(data, base):
    if not data:
        return None 
    new_list = [] # setting new list
    for i in data:
        new_list.append(math.log(i, base)) # appending each solution of the log to the new list
    return new_list
