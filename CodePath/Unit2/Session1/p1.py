Problem 1: Festival Lineup

Given two lists of strings artists and set_times of length n, write a function lineup() that maps each artist to their set time.

An artist artists[i] has set time set_times[i]. Assume i <= 0 < n and len(artists) == len(set_times).
'''


def lineup(artists, set_times):
    index = 0
    new_dict = {}
    for i in artists:
        new_dict[i] = set_times[index]
        index += 1
    return new_dict

# Example Usage:

artists1 = ["Kendrick Lamar", "Chappell Roan", "Mitski", "Rosalia"]
set_times1 = ["9:30 PM", "5:00 PM", "2:00 PM", "7:30 PM"]

artists2 = []
set_times2 = []

print(lineup(artists1, set_times1))
print(lineup(artists2, set_times2))

# Example Output:

# {"Kendrick Lamar": "9:30 PM", "Chappell Roan": "5:00 PM", "Mitski": "2:00 PM", "RosalÃ­a": "7:30 PM"}
# {}
